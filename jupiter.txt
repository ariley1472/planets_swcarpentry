JUPITER FACTS!
--------------
- Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system
- Little known fact, Jupiter is the smallest planet in the solar system.
- Metallic hydrogen is the core. Europa is a cool moon of Jupiter.
- I wonder if there is a point when Jupiter's atmosphere is so thick that we could explore it with a submarine.
